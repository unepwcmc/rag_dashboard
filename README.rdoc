== RAG Dashboard

Produces a Red Amber Green status dashboard for Projects synced from Deltek

Because Deltek is slow and awful, RAG Dashboard works by keeping a local copy of all the projects and clients from Deltek for faster look up and convenience.

You can pull everything from Deltek by running this handy rake task:

`rake deltek:sync`
